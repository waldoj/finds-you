## Use

Enter your Google API key into `finds_you.py`, then plug various phrases into the script. It will populate `finds_you.txt` as it goes. Edit all the cruft out of the lines of text, remote duplicates, etc. Then enter your Mastodon / Mastodon server and auth info into `post.sh`. Create a cron job that will run `post.sh` periodically. Congratulations, you have a goofy bot.
