def process_snippets(snippets, replacements):

    Processes a list of text snippets by applying multiple regex-based 
    find-and-replace operations.

    This function iterates over each snippet in the provided list, applying 
    each specified replacement operation. Each operation consists of a regex pattern 
    and a replacement string.

    Parameters:
    - snippets (list of str): A list of text snippets to be processed.
    - replacements (list of tuple): A list of tuples where each tuple contains a 
      regex pattern (str) and a replacement string (str). Each pattern is applied 
      to the snippets, replacing matches with the corresponding replacement string.

    Returns:
    - list of str: A list containing the processed snippets after all replacement 
      operations have been applied.
